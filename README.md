# Project Background 
The objective of this project is to develop an interactive HR dashboard aimed at empowering HR managers with comprehensive insights into workforce data. This dashboard will provide both high-level summaries for quick overviews and detailed employee records for in-depth analysis, enabling HR teams to uncover key metrics related to employee demographics, performance, retention, and overall workforce trends. This approach will support strategic decision-making, improve workforce planning, and enhance employee engagement across the organization.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas : 

- **Workforce Overview**: Provides a detailed overview of HR trends, focusing on the total number of hired, active, and terminated employees.

- **Departmental and Geographic Distribution**: Analyzes the distribution of employees across different departments and locations, offering insights into workforce concentration and regional presence.

- **Demographics and Performance Analysis**: Examines the demographics, educational backgrounds, and age groups of employees, highlighting performance trends across various education levels and identifying key fluctuations.

- **Compensation and Gender Analysis**: A comparative evaluation of average salaries by gender, education level, average age, and role, providing insights into compensation disparities and organizational equity.
